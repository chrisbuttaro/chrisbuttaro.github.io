		<h1>For, While, and Do Loops</h1>
		<body>
	     <p>
	     For loops are useful when we know beforehand how many times we would like the 
	     compiler to pass through the loop before exiting.  
	     </p>
	     <h3> Example 1</h3>
	     <div>
	      for (int j=0; j<3; j++){<br>
      System.out.println(j);<br>
    }<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>
    In Example 1 we have told the compiler to go through the loop as long as j is less than
    3.  Therefore we know the compiler will go through the loop exactly three times and in
    this case will print a "0" on the first pass, a "1" on the second, and a "2" on the third.
    In this way we can control how many times the loop "goes around."</p>
    <br>
    <p>In contrast While loops are used when we are unsure how many times we would like 
    the loop to execute. Instead we want the loop to continue going around while a condition is 
    true. The statement following "while" will return a boolean value, and the loop will 
    only execute if the statement returns true. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3> Example 2</h3>
	<div>
	int j=1;<br>
    int count=1;<br>
    while (j<1000000){<br>
      j=2*j;<br>
      count++;<br>
      }<br>
      System.out.println("It takes only " +count+ " doubles to reach a million." );
    </div>
    <p>
    In the second Example we need to find out how many times we can double a quantity starting
    at one before we reach one million.  On the first pass j will equal 2, 4 on the second,
    8 on the third and so on.  I used a while loop in this case because I do not know how 
    many times my quantity needs to be doubled, and therefore do not know how many times
    I need the loop to execute.  
    </p><br>
    
    <p>
   A Do-While loop is like a While loop except that it evaluates a boolean expression at the end of 
   the loop guaranteeing that the loop will execute at least the first pass.
	     </p>
	     <div>
	  do {<br>
        j=2*j;<br>
        count++;<br>
      }while (j<1000000);<br>
      System.out.println("It takes only " +count+ " doubles to reach a million." );
    </div>
